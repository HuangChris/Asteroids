# Asteroids!!!

* These aren't so much asteroids as... round things (I love the round things!)
* But you can blow them up, and they can kill you.  
* Fly your power button around and do what you can to kill the round things before they kill you.

## Things to add later:
* Maybe make them not round things?
* Maybe make your ship not a power button?
* Maybe make no-longer-round things split into smaller round things when you hit them?
* Maybe fix that thing where the controls also move the screen around?
* Maybe add game features like lives and score and levels?
