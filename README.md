# Asteroids!!!

* __Asteroids are no longer round things!__
* You can blow them up, and they can kill you. _Be careful, because parts
of the asteroid might be invisible._  
* Fly your power button around and do what you can to kill the asteroids before they kill you.
* You probably thought this might have real instructions on how to play Asteroids.  Nope!

## Things to add later:
* Put a distance limit on bullets __DONE__
* Maybe make them not round things? __DONE__
* Maybe make your ship not a power button? __DONE__
* Maybe make no-longer-round things split into smaller not-round things when you hit them? __DONE__
* Maybe fix that thing where the controls also move the screen around? __DONE__
* Maybe add game features like lives and score and levels? __DONE__
* Definitely clean up some ugly ugly code?
